#
# Zigbee2MQTT — Zigbee bridge over MQTT.
#
# Architecture
# ------------
# Z2M owns the Zigbee USB dongle exclusively.  It publishes device state and
# accepts commands on Mosquitto topics under `zigbee2mqtt/`.  Home Assistant
# discovers devices automatically via MQTT discovery (homeassistant: true).
# Do NOT also enable ZHA in Home Assistant — only one service can own the dongle.
#
# Dongle access
# -------------
# udev creates /dev/zigbee (symlink) owned by group "ha".
# The zigbee2mqtt service user is added to that group.
#
# Unplugging the dongle
# ---------------------
# The service is bound to the dongle's device unit rather than started at boot:
# BindsTo stops it cleanly when the dongle disappears, and the device wants it,
# so it starts again when the dongle comes back.  Without this, pulling the
# dongle for a few seconds made Z2M crash and restart until systemd's start
# limit gave up on it, and it stayed down after the dongle was back.
#
# Secret: mosquitto-z2m-pass.age
#   Single line — the plaintext MQTT password for the zigbee2mqtt user.
#   Written into /var/lib/zigbee2mqtt/secret.yaml at service start so the
#   password never appears in /nix/store.
#
# Web UI: zigbee.<domain> (Caddy -> localhost:8099, Authentik forward auth).
#
# Always-on: yes.  No NFS dependency.  Z2M pairing data lives in
# /var/lib/zigbee2mqtt/ on host root.
