# services/person-mapper.nix
#
# The frigate person mapper: turns Frigate's central face recognition into room
# presence. Frigate runs its local face model on the server and announces each
# face it sees over MQTT (frigate/tracked_object_update, frigate/events and the
# per-camera detect status); this service keeps per-room state and, on each
# change, tells the assistant router who is in each room (one face-source socket
# per room on the router's body port) and publishes the room's people to Home
# Assistant (retained entities plus an event). The parsing, state and payload
# logic are pure and unit-tested in pkgs/frigate-person-mapper; this module is
# the wiring.
#
# It names people from lanbat.deployment.people: Frigate's face-library entry
# must match a person's key, and the mapper filters Frigate's matches to those
# keys. The cameras it watches are settings.cameras, a map of room -> Frigate
# camera name; only a face seen on a room's camera counts for that room.
#
# Always-on: it is in the voice path (the assistant needs to know who is in the
# room). It runs only when Frigate, the broker and the router are all present and
# at least one camera is configured; otherwise the module contributes its
# description and the account is dropped, so nothing runs and nothing is wired.
