# services/music-assistant.nix
#
# Music Assistant — music library controller and multi-room orchestrator.
#
# Why the NixOS module and not a container?
#   `services.music-assistant` exists in pinned nixpkgs (2.7.x) and runs as a
#   native systemd service on the host network stack — no rootless Podman
#   multicast caveats.  CONTRIBUTING.md prefers native modules when available.
#
# Snapcast integration (distribution layer)
# -----------------------------------------
# Snapcast stays declarative in services/snapcast.nix (snapserver on 1704/1705).
# Music Assistant does NOT write to the old FIFO.  When the Snapcast player
# provider is enabled in the MA UI with "Use existing Snapserver", MA connects
# to snapserver's control API (port 1705) and creates per-playback TCP streams
# dynamically via stream_add_stream — see music_assistant/providers/snapcast/
# player.py::_get_or_create_stream in the nixpkgs package source.
#
# Post-deploy: Settings → Player Providers → Snapcast → enable "Use existing
# Snapserver", host 127.0.0.1, control port 1705.  Do NOT use MA's built-in
# snapserver (it would bind the same ports).
#
# Sendspin (builtin WebRTC player provider)
# -----------------------------------------
# MA 2.7.x treats "sendspin" as builtin (builtin=true, allow_disable=false).
# It runs an internal WebRTC signalling server on loopback port 8927 that the
# webserver's sendspin_proxy forwards to from the public MA port (8095/8097).
# Without "sendspin" in the providers list aiosendspin is not installed and the
# provider fails to load at startup, breaking the web UI's browser audio player
# and logging a RuntimeError on every restart.  No extra firewall rules are
# needed: external clients connect through the existing 8095/8097 ports.
#
# Local music library
# -------------------
# The filesystem_local provider reads the music library over NFS; its path is
# set in Music Assistant's UI (docs/deployment-checklist.md), not here. That
# path is Pi-backed (automount, not workload-gated).  MA is always-on:
# we deliberately avoid lanbat.services.*.nfs.drives (which would stop MA when
# the Pi disappears).  The service starts without the mount; library scans fail
# gracefully until NFS is available.
#
# Auth with Home Assistant
# ----------------------
# Browser access to music.<domain> is gated by Caddy forward-auth (Authentik).
# Music Assistant has no Authentik header passthrough like Home Assistant, so
# users sign in via "Login with Home Assistant" (HA OAuth) after Authentik.
# music-assistant-setup provisions the hass plugin, base URL, self-registration,
# and the bidirectional long-lived tokens for the HA integration. It reaches
# both services on the loopback ports, and names them by the subdomains, of
# their descriptions.
#
# Audio sources
# -------------
# music-assistant-sources (after music-assistant-setup, which creates the admin
# it signs in as) makes Music Assistant match the settings below; it is safe to
# run again, so it also repairs a provider removed in the UI:
#   - Radio: the RadioBrowser provider (tens of thousands of stations worldwide,
#     Bulgarian ones included), Radio Paradise, BBC Sounds (live BBC radio and
#     on-demand shows, no login needed) and, with settings.tuneinUsername,
#     TuneIn. settings.stations puts stations in the library by name, found
#     through RadioBrowser or TuneIn, or by stream URL.
#   - Podcasts: iTunes Podcast Search (the settings.podcastCountry charts and
#     search) and one RSS subscription per settings.podcasts URL.
#   - YouTube, PeerTube, LBRY/Odysee, Vimeo: Music Assistant has no provider
#     for them, so media-feed-bridge (pkgs/media-feed-bridge) turns each
#     settings.channels entry into an audio podcast feed on loopback, with
#     yt-dlp, and the sources step subscribes the RSS provider to it. Any
#     channel, playlist or user URL yt-dlp understands works. YouTube Music
#     (Settings → Music Providers) needs a login cookie, so it is left to the UI.
#   - Audiobookshelf: Audiobookshelf is workload-gated and Music Assistant will
#     not add a provider whose server is unreachable, so
#     music-assistant-audiobookshelf is one of Audiobookshelf's gated units: at
#     each unlock it adds the provider, signed in as the owner account that
#     audiobookshelf-bootstrap creates, or reloads it.
# All of it needs the Home Assistant integration (the owner account).
#
# Always-on: yes.  State in /var/lib/music-assistant (provider config, playlists).
