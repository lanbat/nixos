# Jackett — torrent indexer aggregator for qBittorrent searches.
#
# The management UI is only reachable through Caddy and Authentik, restricted
# to the Authentik admins: Jackett has one shared admin account and no roles,
# so everyone who gets in can change indexers and read their credentials.
# Jackett's own listener stays private on port 9117 (the module passes no
# --ListenPublic, and no firewall port is opened); qBittorrent reaches it over
# loopback.
#
# State: /var/lib/jackett holds the indexers' credentials, cookies and the API
# key, so it lives on the workload layer. The nixpkgs module's tmpfiles rule for
# its data directory only creates empty directories under the stub while the
# layer is locked, the same as Nextcloud's; workloadDirs gives the mounted
# directories their owner.
#
# qBittorrent: its Jackett search plugin reads
# /var/lib/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/nova3/engines/jackett.json (/config/... in
# the container). jackett-qbittorrent-plugin writes it from the API key Jackett
# generated, before every qBittorrent start, so the key is never typed in or
# kept in the Nix store and a regenerated key is picked up on the next start.
# A Jackett restart leaves qBittorrent running; it learns a new key when it
# next starts.
#
# Freshness: indexer sites change domains and markup constantly, and the
# Jackett in nixpkgs (started with --NoUpdates, in a read-only store) lags
# upstream by weeks. The fixes are almost all in the indexer definitions, which
# Jackett loads from the app's own Definitions directory and also from
# $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/cardigann/definitions, and the second one wins for an
# indexer present in both. jackett-definitions (a timer, and once at every
# unlock before Jackett starts) copies upstream's definitions there and
# restarts Jackett only when they changed. The binary is pkgs/jackett, pinned
# to a recent release (update it with pkgs/jackett/update.sh), so the bundled
# definitions the sync overrides are recent too.
