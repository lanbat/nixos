# services/home-assistant.nix
#
# Home Assistant — home automation hub.
#
# Why the NixOS module and not a container?
#   The NixOS `services.home-assistant` module handles component packaging,
#   config dir, user/group, and service lifecycle very cleanly.
#   It is significantly easier to maintain than a container for HA specifically
#   because NixOS can manage the Python component set declaratively.
#
# Zigbee
# ------
# Zigbee devices are bridged via Zigbee2MQTT (see zigbee2mqtt.nix).
# Z2M owns the USB dongle and publishes to Mosquitto; HA discovers devices
# via MQTT auto-discovery.  Do NOT add ZHA here — it would conflict with Z2M.
# settings.zigbee2mqttBridge (on by default when Zigbee2MQTT runs on this host)
# adds a notification while the bridge is offline and its card on the Overview
# dashboard.
#
# Other services
# --------------
# The loopback URLs of Home Assistant itself, Frigate, Music Assistant and the
# MQTT port come from those services' descriptions (lanbat.services.<name>.port
# and the Mosquitto endpoint), not literals.
#
# Auth with Authentik
# -------------------
# Browser access is gated by Caddy forward-auth (Authentik session).  The
# hass-auth-header custom component maps X-Authentik-Username to an existing HA
# user, so entitled Authentik users land in HA without a second login.
#
# Companion apps and REST clients bypass forward-auth on /auth/token and /api/*
# and authenticate with HA long-lived tokens as usual.
#
# First-run onboarding is completed automatically by home-assistant-bootstrap
# (owner account + SSO user mirror).  Break-glass local login remains available
# on localhost.
#
# Bluetooth
# ---------
# A USB Bluetooth adapter on the server carries BLE sensors.  hardware.bluetooth
# enables BlueZ; the "bluetooth", "xiaomi_ble" and "bthome" components let HA
# scan and decode the advertisements.
#
# home-assistant-post-setup also writes the bluetooth integration's own config
# entry, one per adapter.  Home Assistant creates those by itself only during
# onboarding, so on an instance onboarded before the adapter existed it would
# otherwise wait for a click in the UI and never scan.
#
# Stock-firmware Xiaomi models such as the LYWSD02MMC clock broadcast encrypted
# and need a per-device bind key.  With lanbat.deployment.haXiaomiBle set, those
# keys live in ha-xiaomi-ble.age and home-assistant-post-setup writes one
# xiaomi_ble config entry per device, so a key is never typed into the UI and
# never reaches the Nix store.  Obtain one locally from
# atc1441.github.io/Temp_universal_mi_activate.html; the Xiaomi cloud is not
# involved.  (The LYWSD02MMC has no Telink OTA service, so custom firmware would
# need a wired programmer; the bind key is the practical route.)
#
# Sensors reflashed with pvvx firmware broadcast BTHome v2 in the clear and need
# no key; "bthome" covers those.  Anything else is discovered in the UI.
#
# Note: the adapter shares 2.4 GHz with the Zigbee coordinator.  Keep the two
# dongles physically apart or both will degrade.
#
# Voice
# -----
# home-assistant-post-setup adds the Wyoming services and satellites
# (services/wyoming.nix) and makes a "Voice" pipeline the preferred one:
# openWakeWord, faster-whisper, piper, and as the conversation agent the LLM
# in lanbat.haLlm, or Home Assistant's own agent without one. Local intents
# are tried first, so simple commands don't wait for the LLM.
#
# Always-on: yes — HA should survive Pi NFS loss.
