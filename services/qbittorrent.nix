#
# qBittorrent — torrent client with web UI.
#
# Web UI: VueTorrent (pkgs.vuetorrent), which works on phones as well as
#   desktop browsers, unlike qBittorrent's own. qBittorrent serves it as its
#   alternative web UI from the package, mounted read-only into the container,
#   so it updates with nixpkgs and the API (Homepage's widget) is unchanged.
#
# Storage split
# -------------
# Server-local:
#   /var/lib/qbittorrent/   — qBittorrent config, fastresume files, session state
#
# Pi-backed via NFS, media split across both drives by folder:
#   /srv/storage/a/media/  → /media/a  (movies, TV, music videos)
#   /srv/storage/b/media/  → /media/b  (music, documentaries, ROMs, books, ...)
# Each category saves into its folder. The Pi creates the folders
# (modules/pi/storage.nix), owned by qbt, group media.
#
# Settings: qBittorrent's configuration is declared, not edited in the web UI.
#   lanbat.services.qbittorrent.settings holds
#     categories   — category name -> save path (a "/" nests a subcategory)
#     preferences  — qBittorrent.conf as section -> key -> value
#   and both are written to categories.json and qBittorrent.conf before every
#   start. qBittorrent reads them only at start, so a change made in the web UI
#   lasts until the next restart, then reverts. This module sets the keys the
#   deployment depends on (the loopback-only, Authentik-only web UI and
#   VueTorrent) and a few defaults; a profile sets the rest (see
#   docs/extensibility.md#service-settings).
#
# NFS dependency: strong.
#   If Pi storage disappears while a torrent is active, qBittorrent will
#   write I/O errors.  We stop it immediately and restart when NFS returns.
#
# Auth: Authentik, through Caddy's forward auth, is the only login, for the web
#   UI and the API alike. After it, everyone shares the one instance:
#   qBittorrent skips its own login for requests from the server's address,
#   which is where Caddy's requests come from. The port listens only on the
#   server's loopback, so nothing on the LAN reaches qBittorrent without
#   Authentik.
#
# Audit: caddy.auditLog records who did what, with the Authentik user on each
#   line of /var/log/caddy/access-torrent.<domain>.log: page loads and every
#   action (adding, pausing, deleting a torrent, changing a setting), which the
#   API takes as POST requests. See docs/operations.md.
#
# Homepage: its widget reads the torrent list from qBittorrent on the server's
#   loopback (Homepage uses host networking), which qBittorrent answers without
#   a login, so the widget needs no credentials and Caddy no exception.
