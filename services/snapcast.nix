# services/snapcast.nix
#
# Snapcast server — synchronised multi-room audio distribution.
#
# Design
# ------
# - Snapserver broadcasts audio in sync to all connected snapclients (Pi).
# - Music Assistant (services/music-assistant.nix) is the controller/source:
#   it connects to snapserver's control API (port 1705) and registers dynamic
#   TCP input streams per playback via stream_add_stream — it does not write
#   to a named pipe.  See music_assistant/providers/snapcast/player.py in the
#   nixpkgs music-assistant package (_get_or_create_stream).
# - Post-deploy, enable MA's Snapcast provider with "Use existing Snapserver"
#   (127.0.0.1:1705).  Do not let MA launch its built-in snapserver.
# - The web UI / control API (port 1780) is proxied by Caddy at
#   audio.<domain> and protected by Authentik forward auth.
# - Streaming port (1704) and control port (1705) admit only declared clients
#   (see Clients below); everyone else on the LAN is refused.
#
# Stream source
# -------------
# The static "default" stream is an idle TCP listener MA switches away from
# when playing.  MA creates additional streams named "Music Assistant - …"
# on random ports (4953+) via the control API; ffmpeg pipes PCM into them.
#
# Ports
# -----
#   1704 TCP  — streaming   (snapclient connects here)
#   1705 TCP  — control API (snapclient, MA, web UI)
#   1780 TCP  — HTTP API + web UI (proxied by Caddy, localhost-only)
#
# Clients
# -------
# Snapcast has no authentication, so the firewall decides who may play and
# control: 1704 and 1705 admit exactly
#   - the hosts of services that consume snapcast (snapclient on a Pi), from the
#     endpoint table;
#   - the androidDevices boxes with Snapdroid (de.badaix.snapcast) in packages;
#   - settings.clients, for anything else (a speaker, a phone app), by IPv4
#     address or by MAC. A MAC admits a device over IPv4 and IPv6 alike, which
#     an Android box needs: it connects over IPv6 from rotating privacy
#     addresses, so no IPv6 address rule would hold.
# The others are admitted over IPv4. Nothing else reaches the ports, on either
# family.
# Music Assistant talks to the snapserver over loopback and needs no entry.
#
# Discovery
# ---------
# Snapclients (Snapdroid on Android TV, snapclient on the Pi) find the server
# via mDNS (_snapcast._tcp / _snapcast-ctrl._tcp).  That requires mdns_enabled
# and publish in snapserver.conf, plus Avahi D-Bus access (DynamicUser blocks
# it by default — see the avahi-snapserver group below).
#
# Snapserver must listen on IPv6 (::) as well as IPv4.  Avahi publishes the
# host's IPv6 addresses in mDNS and Android clients prefer them; with a v4-only
# bind they get "connection refused".  Binding :: accepts both (Linux dual-stack).
# Avahi IPv6 is also disabled so mDNS prefers the LAN IPv4.
# http.host is the LAN IP (cover-art URLs) — same address snapclient uses on the Pi.
#
# Always-on: yes.  No NFS dependency.
