# services/jellyfin.nix
#
# Jellyfin media server.
#
# Why the NixOS module?
#   `services.jellyfin` is well-maintained, handles the user/group, config
#   dir, and service lifecycle cleanly.  No reason to containerize.
#
# Storage split
# -------------
# Server-local:
#   /var/lib/jellyfin/            — config, database, metadata, posters
#   /var/cache/jellyfin/          — transcodes (safe to delete at any time)
#
# Pi-backed via NFS, media split across both drives by folder:
#   /srv/storage/a/media/         — movies, TV, music videos
#   /srv/storage/b/media/         — music, documentaries, books, etc.
#   /srv/storage/b/media/adult/   — private group only; excluded from Jellyfin
#
# NFS dependency: strong.
#   Jellyfin should not run if Pi storage is unavailable — it would
#   write error states into its database and display a broken library.
#   We declare a hard BindsTo dependency so systemd stops Jellyfin when
#   the mount disappears and restarts it when the mount returns.
#
# Discovery
# ---------
# TV and mobile apps find the server via UDP broadcast on port 7359 (not mDNS).
# Caddy serves HTTPS on 443; discovery must advertise that URL so clients do
# not fall back to the blocked local HTTP port 8096.
#
# First-run onboarding, media libraries, plugins, and Authentik SSO are
# completed automatically by jellyfin-bootstrap.
#
# Metadata
# --------
# Jellyfin itself fetches metadata only for movies, TV and music (TMDb, OMDb,
# MusicBrainz, TheAudioDB). jellyfin-bootstrap adds the official Bookshelf
# plugin (Google Books, Comic Vine) for Books and, with settings.imvdb, the
# IMVDb plugin for Music Videos, which needs an API key from imvdb.com in
# secrets/jellyfin-imvdb-env.age. Installing either fetches its library's
# metadata again. Audiobooks get no online metadata here, and a book in several
# files shows as one item per file.
#
# Subtitles
# ---------
# The Open Subtitles plugin is installed by jellyfin-bootstrap. With
# settings.opensubtitles, the account credentials from
# secrets/jellyfin-opensubtitles-env.age (OPENSUBTITLES_USERNAME,
# OPENSUBTITLES_PASSWORD) are provisioned and written into the plugin's
# configuration so Jellyfin can download subtitles automatically.
#
# That bootstrap logs in to Home Assistant and configures OIDC against
# Authentik, so it only exists when the deployment runs both. Without them
# Jellyfin still serves media; it just keeps its own accounts and is not
# registered with Home Assistant.
