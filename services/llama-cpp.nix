# services/llama-cpp.nix
#
# A small local language model for Home Assistant's voice conversation agent,
# served by llama.cpp's llama-server on this host's loopback.
#
# Home Assistant (services/home-assistant.nix) points its conversation agent
# at it when lanbat.deployment.haLlm.baseUrl is this service's URL
# (http://127.0.0.1:8091/v1) and model is a name from the table below. Local
# intents are tried first, so only what Home Assistant cannot match itself
# ("turn on the kitchen light") reaches the model.
#
# The service runs only where haLlm is on the loopback: a profile that uses an
# outside API, or none, imports this file and gets nothing from it.
#
# What fits (measured on the i5-8500T server, with Frigate running)
# ------------------------------------------------------------------
# The server has six cores, no discrete GPU and little spare memory, so the
# model must be small, the prompt short and its start cached:
#
#   model        decode      prompt processing   warm request (cached start)
#   qwen3-1.7b   ~10-15 t/s  ~50 t/s             2-5 s per model round
#   qwen3-4b     ~5-8 t/s    ~20 t/s             10-20 s per model round
#
# Prompt processing is the cost that matters: a 900-token prompt takes about
# 20 s on qwen3-1.7b and 40 s on qwen3-4b the first time. llama-server keeps
# the previous request's tokens (one slot, --cache-reuse), so Home Assistant's
# prompt must open with text that does not change between requests. The
# conversation agent's prompt is built that way in home-assistant-post-setup:
# instructions and the entity list first, no clock and no device states, which
# the model reads with a tool instead. The first request after a start, or
# after the exposed entities change, pays the full prompt once.
#
# The binary
# ----------
# nixpkgs builds llama.cpp for baseline x86-64: no AVX2, so token generation
# ran 5-10 times slower here than with it (1.2 against 8 t/s on one model),
# and the BLAS path is slower and spins threads. The package below is the
# same one rebuilt with AVX2/FMA/F16C/BMI2 (all of which the server's CPU has)
# and without BLAS. It compiles on first deploy.
#
# Resource limits
# ---------------
# The server also runs Frigate (about two cores, one of them licence plate
# recognition), so the unit is capped and runs at lower priority: three
# threads for generation, four for prompt processing, a share of CPU below the
# default, 400% at most, a memory ceiling with no swap (swap is already full
# on the server, and locked pages cannot be swapped out anyway), and the
# kernel's OOM killer picks it first. Measured without any of these on:
# llama-server's threads wait for one another, so a thread descheduled by a
# busier service slows all of them; keep the thread count at or below the free
# cores rather than lowering the priority further.
#
# Settings
# --------
# lanbat.services.llama-cpp.settings (options below): the model, the threads
# and the context size. A profile sets them from a module in the host's
# modules (docs/extensibility.md#service-settings):
#
#   lanbat.services.llama-cpp.settings.model = "qwen3-4b";
#
# Always-on: yes. State is the pinned model in the Nix store; no secrets.
