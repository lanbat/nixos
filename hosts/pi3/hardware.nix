# hosts/pi3/hardware.nix
#
# Raspberry Pi 3 (B or B+), booting from microSD with the stock NixOS aarch64
# SD image: U-Boot reading extlinux entries, mainline kernel from
# cache.nixos.org. hosts/pi5/hardware.nix is the Pi 5's (nixos-raspberrypi), so
# a Pi 3 host takes this one with `platform = "raspberry-pi-3"` in its deploy
# entry.
#
# Importing the SD image module gives the filesystems the image is flashed
# with (NIXOS_SD as /, FIRMWARE as /boot/firmware), the extlinux bootloader and
# the grow-on-first-boot of the root partition, so a card flashed from the
# official image switches to this configuration in place, the way the Pi 5 does
# (docs/pi3-satellite.md).
#
# 1 GB of RAM: compressed swap in RAM keeps a build or a nix evaluation from
# being killed. The journal is persistent but capped, so a crash leaves a log.
