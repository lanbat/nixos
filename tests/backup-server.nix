# pkgs/scripts/backup-server.sh copies each service's state with copy_state,
# which skips a directory the host does not have instead of failing the whole
# backup: a profile need not run every service, and a service's state can move
# (Frigate's config is now rendered from the profile). Runs the script's own
# copy_state in bash against a scratch tree.
