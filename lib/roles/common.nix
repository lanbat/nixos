# lib/roles/common.nix
#
# What every built-in role shares: the hostname and static LAN address from the
# deploy entry, the firewall baseline and the state version, so a change to any
# of them is made once.
#
# A role merges this into its own configuration rather than importing it:
#
#   args@{ lib, ... }: {
#     config = lib.mkMerge [ (import ./common.nix args) { ... } ];
#   }
#
# The module system orders the definitions of a list option (nameservers,
# firewall ports, interface addresses) by where their module sits among all
# modules, and an imported module sits elsewhere than its importer. Merged in
# place, these definitions keep the exact position they had when every role
# wrote them out, next to the role's own, so nothing another module adds to the
# same lists moves. It is still a module in its own right.
