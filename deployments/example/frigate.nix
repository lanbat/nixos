# Frigate settings for the example profile. services/frigate.nix documents
# every option; the values here are placeholders that show each of them.
#
# A real profile keeps its own deployments/<profile>/frigate.nix next to its
# deploy.nix (gitignored, like deploy.nix) and lists it in
# hosts.server.modules.
#
# go2rtc ingests each camera stream once and Frigate reads it back from the
# local restream. Credentials stay in the frigate-rtsp-env secret: sources
# only name {FRIGATE_RTSP_USER} and {FRIGATE_RTSP_PASSWORD}.
