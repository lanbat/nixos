# modules/core/voice-satellite-audio.nix
#
# The audio a Linux Voice Assistant satellite needs on any host (backend
# "lva"): a system-wide PipeWire with its PulseAudio server, a fixed mono
# capture node for the microphone, and optionally WebRTC echo cancellation.
#
# LVA's audio library (soundcard) talks to a PulseAudio server and nothing
# else, so a host without a sound server (the server) gets PipeWire here; the
# Pis already run one for Snapcast and the TV (modules/pi/audio.nix), and this
# adds to it. Clients need the pipewire group; LVA's account has it.
#
# Microphone
# ----------
# The microphone's capture node is renamed lanbat_ps_eye_capture and set to
# one channel, so PipeWire downmixes a microphone array (the PlayStation Eye
# has four) and LVA opens it by a stable name rather than by whatever the
# card calls itself. WirePlumber's device properties carry the USB IDs but
# don't reach the node, which has only ALSA's "USBvvvv:pppp" components
# string; the node rule matches that.
#
# Echo cancellation (echoCancellation.enable)
# -------------------------------------------
# libpipewire-module-echo-cancel records from the microphone node and offers
# the cancelled signal as lanbat_aec_mic, using what is played into its sink,
# lanbat_aec_playback, as the reference. LVA records from the one and plays
# its replies into the other, so its own voice is cancelled. Snapcast plays
# straight to the speaker, so music is not in the reference and is not
# cancelled, unless echoCancellation.includeMusic sends it through the sink too
# (an experiment: it costs CPU for every second of music).
