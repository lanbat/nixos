"""Runtime people: who was enrolled at runtime, kept across restarts.

The Nix people file (--people-file) is the base: who the profile says the
assistant may know, fixed at deploy time. A person met later is added here and
remembered in a small JSON file in the router's state directory. At startup the
two are merged, the overlay winning, so an enrolled person is recognised again.

Only the runtime-added people are written, never the whole set: dropping
someone from the Nix file still takes effect on the next start.
