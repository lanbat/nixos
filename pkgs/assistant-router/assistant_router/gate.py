"""T0: decisions that need no model.

Measured on real transcripts (2026-10-08): the microphone picks up the
assistant's own replies, radio and film dialogue, and one-word fragments, and
a small model acts on them. Rules catch those for free, and send requests that
plainly need knowledge or search straight to the cloud tier.
