"""Messages the mapper sends to the assistant router's body socket.

The mapper is a `face-source` client (not a body): one connection per room. It
sends a `hello` naming the room, then the room's full current set of recognised
people whenever it changes. The router replaces the room's faces on every
message, so a person who left simply isn't in the next set.
